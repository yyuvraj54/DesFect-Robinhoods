# DesFect-Robinhoods
As India has the second largest population in the world we suffer with overcrowding issues in many places and these crowding every time leads to some big accidents , many people die and some injured in these disasters .
Other than crowding many people suffering from some breathing or health problem goes to some place without knowing the live update of that place and this leads to some big problem afterwards.

# Solution:
To solve these critical problems we have designed and developed a website which can show some best and safe places near you by getting some real-time data through different APIs that helps the algorithm to know about the place better and can sort top places near you and tells which place is good to hangout.
Any user already present or have visited the place recently can submit the real-time data that whether the place is less or more crowded which can help our algo to determine whether the place is safe to visit at that time or not.
